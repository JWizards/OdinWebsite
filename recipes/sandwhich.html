        <h2>Fried Egg Sandwhichs!</h1>
        <p>Fried Egg Sandwhiches are easy to whip up and quite filling! Also extremely delicious</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Two Bread slices</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Olive oil (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Toast the bread and keep aside (using olive oil). Melt butter and toss egg in while hot and bubbling (you should hear it sizzle).
            Salt and pepper the egg quickly then smash a toasted slice on top. Move the toast smashed egg around to squish in the egg edges.
            Flip and add sauces like ketchup or cheese if preferred. Then close the sandwhich with another toasted bread and heat in the pan.
            Enjoy!

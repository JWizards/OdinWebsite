These notes are for if I get rusty with these concepts down the line:

```
<DOCTYPE! html> 

<html lang = "en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
    </head>

    <body>
        <a href="./pages/about.html">Or me!</a>
    </body>
</html>
```

<DOCTYPE! html> specifies the version to be html5. 
Do <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd"> for older versions.

The html tag is the root of the webpage. It is relevant for Javascript down the line.

Set the lang="en" for the purpose of informing assistive technologies like screen readers with correct pronounciation.

<meta charset="UTF-8"> Sets the characterset which helps browsers render the text and special characters properly.

        <h3> Html practice sets </h3>
        <ol>
            <li> I hate writing this sentence first on any list</li>
            <li> This sentence is best written in the number #3 spot</li>
            <li> This sentence fits anywhere </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li> bullet points drive me crazy </li>
            <li> they're small and round </li>
            <li> you have to manually count them</li>
            <li> why wouldn't you want to be able to reference them?</li>
            <li> who wants disorder in their work?</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Don't Click Me!</a></li>
